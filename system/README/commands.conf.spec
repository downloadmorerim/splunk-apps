#   Version 6.1.2 
#
# This file contains possible attribute/value pairs for creating search commands for 
# any custom search scripts created.  Add your custom search script to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/searchscripts/
# or $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/MY_APP/bin/.  For the latter, put a custom commands.conf in 
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/MY_APP.  For the former, put your custom commands.conf 
# in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/.

# There is a commands.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/.  For examples, see 
# commands.conf.example.  You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.

# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the documentation 
# located at http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#     * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top of the file.
#     * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are multiple default
#       stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of multiple definitions of the same
#       attribute, the last definition in the file wins.
#     * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific stanza, the
#       value in the specific stanza takes precedence.


[<STANZA_NAME>]
	* Each stanza represents a search command; the command is the stanza name.
	* The stanza name invokes the command in the search language.
	* Set the following attributes/values for the command.  Otherwise, Splunk uses the defaults.

type = <string>
	* Type of script: python, perl
	* Defaults to python.

filename = <string>
	* Name of script file for command.
	* <script-name>.pl for perl.
	* <script-name>.py for python.

local = [true|false]
        * If true, specifies that the command should be run on the search head only 
	* Defaults to false

perf_warn_limit = <integer>
	* Issue a performance warning message if more than this many input events are passed to this external command (0 = never)
	* Defaults to 0 (disabled)

streaming = [true|false]
	* Specify whether the command is streamable.
	* Defaults to false.
	
maxinputs = <integer>
	* Maximum number of events that can be passed to the command for each invocation.
        * This limit cannot exceed the value of maxresultrows in limits.conf.
	* 0 for no limit.
	* Defaults to 50000.

passauth = [true|false]
	* If set to true, passes an authentication token on the start of input.
	* Defaults to false.

run_in_preview = [true|false]
	* Specify whether to run this command if generating results just for preview rather than final output.
	* Defaults to true
       	
enableheader = [true|false]
	* Indicate whether or not your script is expecting header information or not.
	* Currently, the only thing in the header information is an auth token.
	* If set to true it will expect as input a head section + '\n' then the csv input
	* NOTE: Should be set to true if you use splunk.Intersplunk
	* Defaults to true.

retainsevents = [true|false]
	* Specify whether the command retains events (the way the sort/dedup/cluster commands do) or whether 
	it transforms them (the way the stats command does). 
	* Defaults to false.

generating = [true|false]
	* Specify whether your command generates new events. If no events are passed to the command, 
	will it generate events?
	* Defaults to false.

generates_timeorder = [true|false]
        * If generating = true, does command generate events in descending time order (latest first)
	* Defaults to false.

overrides_timeorder = [true|false]
        * If generating = false and streaming=true, does command change the order of events with respect to time?
	* Defaults to false.

requires_preop = [true|false]
        * Specify whether the command sequence specified by the 'streaming_preop' key is required for 
	proper execution or is it an optimization only
        * Default is false (streaming_preop not required)

streaming_preop = <string>
	* A string that denotes the requested pre-streaming search string.

required_fields = <string>
 	* A comma separated list of fields that this command may use.  
        * Informs previous commands that they should retain/extract these fields if possible.  No error is generated if a field specified is missing.
 	* Defaults to '*'

supports_multivalues = [true|false]
	* Specify whether the command supports multivalues.  
        * If true, multivalues will be treated as python lists of strings, instead of a flat string 
	(when using Intersplunk to interpret stdin/stdout).
        * If the list only contains one element, the value of that element will be returned, rather than a list 
	(for example, isinstance(val, basestring) == True).

supports_getinfo = [true|false]
	* Specifies whether the command supports dynamic probing for settings 
	(first argument invoked == __GETINFO__ or __EXECUTE__).

supports_rawargs = [true|false]
        * Specifies whether the command supports raw arguments being passed to it or if it prefers parsed arguments 
	(where quotes are stripped).
	* If unspecified, the default is false

undo_scheduler_escaping = [true|false]
        * Specifies whether the commands raw arguments need to be unesacped.
        * This is perticularly applies to the commands being invoked by the scheduler.
        * This applies only if the command supports raw arguments(supports_rawargs).
	* If unspecified, the default is false

requires_srinfo = [true|false]
	* Specifies if the command requires information stored in SearchResultsInfo.  
	If true, requires that enableheader be set to true,  and the full pathname of the info file (a csv file) 
	will be emitted in the header under the key 'infoPath'
	* If unspecified, the default is false


needs_empty_results = [true|false]
        * Specifies whether or not this search command needs to be called with intermediate empty search results 
        * If unspecified, the default is true 

changes_colorder = [true|false]
        * Specify whether the script output should be used to change the column ordering of the fields.
	* Default is true

outputheader = <true/false>
	* If set to true, output of script should be a header section + blank line + csv output
        * If false, script output should be pure csv only
        * Default is false

clear_required_fields = [true|false]
        * If true, required_fields represents the *only* fields required.  
	If false, required_fields are additive to any fields that may be required by subsequent commands.
	* In most cases, false is appropriate for streaming commands and true for reporting commands
        * Default is false

stderr_dest = [log|message|none]
	* What do to with the stderr output from the script
	* 'log' means to write the output to the job's search.log.   
	* 'message' means to write each line as an search info message.  The message level can be set to
	adding that level (in ALL CAPS) to the start of the line, e.g. "WARN my warning message."  
	* 'none' means to discard the stderr output
	* Defaults to log
